## Abstract {.page_break_before}
Graph databases are getting more and more relevant for storing complex data and their relationships in different fields like medicine or biology. [@pmid:29377902, @DOI:10.7554/eLife.26726]. Graph databases like neo4j already demonstrated their power by connecting heterogeneous data in a graph database [Hetionet] and an increasing number of projects starts connecting their data with graph databases. 
In contrast to, currently dominant relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL, graph databases are more focused on the connection between the data values and their data types. In addition to the storing function, which makes graphical databases interesting on their own, data exploration is another great opportunity, which graph databases like Neo4j may offer to their users. Furthermore, the great Neo4j community and their already implemented tools make Neo4j even more useful in the sense of exploring patient and clinical data sources. The following work suggests a simple workflow that may empower domain experts to explore their data in a visual way and leverage connection in data to discover new hypothesises or new structures in their data which might be hidden in the table format.
