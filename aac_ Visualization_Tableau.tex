\section{State of the art}\label{s2}
Researching and analyzing clinical data with visualization tools is already a known research field~\cite{Caban.2015, Sittig.2015, UnberathPhilipp.2019, Festag.2019}. Sitting et al. showed, that 


\section{Concept}\label{s3}
For our implementation we used the commercially available software Tableau Desktop provided by Tableau\textregistered. The interaction with Tableau Desktop works by translating drag-and-drop actions into data queries via an intuitive user interface. For a first introduction of the user interface see also Ko and Chang~\cite{Ko.2017}. 
Tableau can be connected to multiple data sources like spreadsheets or text files, or for instance in a big data, relational database on a server. Here we used the provided 26 comma-separated values (CSV) files and build the corresponding data model based on the information about the MIMIC-III data structure provided by the PhysioNet website (https://mimic.physionet.org/). Fig.~\ref{f1} shows an overview of the used data model to interact with the provided data. So-called worksheets are used as the basis for creating dashboards and can be individualized depending on the question. For the visual representation of the existing data, Tableau uses a total of four possible forms of the data values. Tableau uses the following measurement types: a) continuous aggregate measure, b) discrete aggregate measure, c) continuous disaggregate measure, d) discrete disaggregate measure in which b) and d) are considered as dimensions by Tableau.
New data values can be added via so-called calculated fields and also displayed in the visualization. Tableau uses its own calculation syntax for the calculated fields that is reminiscent of Excel statements. Using so-called filters, data rows can be selected and also be changed dynamically using parameters. With these tools, worksheets can be specially adapted and thus used as a basis for dashboards. Dashboards are another way of interaction for the user, as individual worksheets can be linked using so-called actions.

\section{Implementation}\label{s4}



\section{Discussion and Outlook}\label{s5}
The dashboards created with Tableau Desktop represent a customizable and expandable presentation of clinical data. It is easy to imagine that, in addition to the area of application shown, other recurring questions can be presented, such as ...
A major limitation regarding the reusability of worksheets and dashboards with Tableau is that the visualizations or calculations depend on the correct designation and the data type used. If the name or type of a data field changes in the underlying data model over time, it may be that all the visualizations and calculations that are dependent on it have to be adapted accordingly and cannot be used. Reusability could be increased through a uniform and generally applicable data model. It is conceivable, for example, that the visualization shown is based on a general data model such as SNOMED CT instead of the MIMIC data model and can act as the basis for the data model.

%%As there is no standard for the visualization of clinical time series data, every system uses self-designed charting tools for the display of patient data. Sittig et al. showed that a variety of widely used commercial EHRs do not optimally visualize data, which does not only hinder an easy and quick interpretation of the data, but may promote misinterpretation.
%The approach of this study combines best practices coming from literature and experts to generate a tool for unambiguous and easy to interpret time series charts. The extensible and parameterizable design of this tool allows its adaption to local preferences.

\section{Conclusion}\label{s6}
Using Tableau Software, we developed two interactive dashboards to display time-dependent variables. The approach presented can be expanded or adapted depending on the context and thus supplement already established analysis methods for specific questions. An implementation of the presented dashboard is available at ...
