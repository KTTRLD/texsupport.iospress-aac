\begin{abstract}

The meaningful visualization of clinical records can help to facilitate interpretation and exploration among physicians scientists or clinicians, especially with extensive data sets. The MIMIC-III database is an intensive care database, which documents in detail the course and treatment of more than 40,000 patients and can be used as the basis for visualization tools in the medical field. In the present work, we developed two exemplary dashboards with Tableau software, that display time series for individual patients and for a selected cohort on the MIMIC-Database. Once created, dashboards can be adapted for specific queries by implementing of dynamic parameters and thus reused. This enables the interactive visualization and exploration of clinical data for non-technical users and also allows them to create customized dashboards.

\section{Introduction}\label{s1}

\subsection{Background}\label{s1.1}
\noindent Tableau is a software platform designed for visual exploration and was initially developed and used for
data analysis outside of the medical field [Literatur]. In the meantime, due to the continuously growing
amounts of data and the desire to be able to use this information more efficiently in a clinical and
scientific context, medicine has also become a possible field of application for data visualization tools
such as Tableau ~\cite{Ko.2017}. A clinical data set that has already been used to visualize patient data is the MIMIC
(Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)) database ~\cite{Festag.2019,Lee.2016}.

\section{Implementation}\label{s4}

\section{Discussion and Outlook}\label{s5}

\section{Conclusion}\label{s6}
Using Tableau Software, we developed two interactive dashboards to display time-dependent variables. The approach presented can be expanded or adapted depending on the context and thus supplement already established analysis methods for specific questions. An implementation of the presented dashboard is available at ...
