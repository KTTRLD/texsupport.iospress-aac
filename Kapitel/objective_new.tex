The objective of this work is to use Tableau Desktop to create interactive and reusable visualizations for MIMIC-III data. This serves as an example use case for clinical data and evaluate the potential applicability of such visualizations as an exploration and analysis tool for a potential data warehouse system.
The created dashboards might serve as a template for visual data analysis and exploration tool so that medically trained researchers can obtain clinical information more easily.
The requirements to be met by the implemented dashboards are:
\begin{itemize}
\item A user can display the course of time-dependent variables like blood pressure for a patient or for a cohort and dynamically adjust the variable.
\item The user can select a patient cohort by dynamic filtering of variables contained in the data.
\item The dashboards should be easily expandable so that, medically trained researchers can make their own basic extensions or additions to the dashboards.
\end{itemize}
