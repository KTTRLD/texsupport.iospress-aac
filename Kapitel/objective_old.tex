The objective of this work is to develop and evaluate the provide a template for a visual data analysis
and exploration tool for time series values, so that medically trained researchers can obtain clinical
information more easily. The requirements to be met by the implemented dashboards are:
\begin{itemize}
\item A user can display the course of time-dependent variables like blood pressure for a patient or for a cohort and dynamically adjust the variable.
\item The user can select a patient cohort by dynamic filtering of variables contained in the data.
\item The dashboards should be easily expandable so that, medically trained researchers can make their own basic extensions or additions to the dashboards.
\end{itemize}
