The objective of this work is to develop and evaluate the provide a template for a visual data analysis
and exploration tool for time series values, so that medically trained researchers can obtain clinical
information more easily. The requirements to be met by the implemented dashboards are:
\begin{itemize}
\item A user can display the course of time-dependent variables like blood pressure for a patient or for a cohort and dynamically adjust the variable.
\item The user can select a patient cohort by dynamic filtering of variables contained in the data.
\item The dashboards should be easily expandable so that, medically trained researchers can make their own basic extensions or additions to the dashboards.
\end{itemize}

. One Dashboards gives the user a brief overview of the patient information stored in the data, another dashboard displays laboratory time series data for individual patients and with the third dashboard,  Once created, dashboards can be adapted for specific questions by implementing dynamic parameters and thus reused.


Demographic information (age, ethnicity, gender, marital status, religion), Administrative information (admission ICU service type, admission source, admission type, number of days between ICU and hospital admissions, insurance type), Patient outcomes (mortality at 28 days post-discharge from the hospital, hospital length of stay, hospital mortality, ICU mortality, ICU length of stay, 2-year survival days post-discharge from the hospital), Vital signs (heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, body temperature), Lab test results (bicarbonate, calcium, chlorine, creatinine, glucose, hematocrit, lactate, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, white blood cell count), Interventions (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, total time on mechanical ventilation, vasopressor administration), Miscellaneous (amount of colloids administered, amount of crystalloids administered, body mass index, fluid balance, height, primary ICD-9, SOFA (sequential organ failure assessment) score, SAPS (simplified acute physiology score) I score, urine output, weight)

Administrative information, Demographic information, Interventions, Lab test results, Patient outcomes, Vital signs and other miscellaneous variables 


\begin{itemize}
\item A user can display the course of time-dependent variables like blood pressure for a patient or for a cohort and dynamically adjust the variable.
\item The user can select a patient cohort by dynamic filtering of variables contained in the data.
\item The dashboards should be easily expandable so that, medically trained researchers can make their own basic extensions or additions to the dashboards.
\end{itemize}

This serves as an example use case for clinical data and evaluate the potential applicability of such visualizations as an exploration and analysis tool for a potential data warehouse system.
The created dashboards might serve as a template for visual data analysis and exploration tool so that medically trained researchers can obtain clinical information more easily.
