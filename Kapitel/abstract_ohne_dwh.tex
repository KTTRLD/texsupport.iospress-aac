The meaningful visualization of clinical records can help to facilitate interpretation and exploration among physicians or clinicians scientists, especially with constantly growing clinical data sets. The MIMIC-III database is a freely accessible intensive care database, which documents in detail the course and treatment of more than 40,000 patients and can be used as the basis for visualization tools in the medical field like for instance needed in the context of clinical data warehouse systems. In the present work, we developed exemplary dashboards with Tableau software, that display time series data for individual patients and for a selected cohort on the MIMIC-Database. Once created, dashboards can be adapted for specific queries by implementing of dynamic parameters and thus reused. This enables the interactive visualization and exploration of clinical data for non-technical users and also allows them to create customized dashboards.
