The unambiguous and easy to interpret visualization of clinical patient records can help to facilitate decision making and exploration among physicians or clinicians scientists, especially with constantly growing clinical data sets. The MIMIC-III database is a freely accessible intensive care database, which documents in detail the course and treatment of more than 40,000 patients and was already used for visualization tools in the medical field. In the present work we used Tableau Desktop, a commercial visual analytic software, to visualize MIMIC-III data with so called dashboards which might serve as a potential visualization tool for clinical data. We developed exemplary interactive dashboards, which display time series data for individual patients and a dashboard to select a patient cohort based on provided parameters like age, gender, diseases classification codes and others to select cohorts on the MIMIC-Database. This dashboards might serve as a template for further visualizations for this data set and 

Once created, dashboards can be adapted for specific queries by implementing dynamic parameters and thus reused. This approach might be useful to enable the interactive visualization and exploration of clinical data for non-technical users and also allows them to create customized dashboards for their own needs.

 in order to provide a template wich might be useful health researchers and clinicians who may have limited computer proficiency a visualization tool to facilitate decision making and exploration, .
